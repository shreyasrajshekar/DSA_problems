# 🧩 DSA Problems

A collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems that I’m solving while learning and practicing for coding interviews and contests.  
Each problem is uploaded with its **solution code** and sometimes with **explanations/notes**.

## 📂 Current Problems

- **Tower of Hanoi (Iterative using Stack)**  
  - Problem: Move `n` disks from the source rod to the destination rod using an auxiliary rod, following the rules of Hanoi.  
  - Usual solution is recursive, but here it’s solved **iteratively using a stack** to simulate the call stack.  
  - Concepts: **Stacks**, **Simulation of Recursion**, **Divide & Conquer**  
  - [Code](./hanoi.py) *(update filename if different)*

## 🚀 Roadmap
I’ll be solving problems in the following order:
1. **Basics** – Recursion, Arrays, Strings  
2. **Core DSA** – Linked List, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Binary Search  
3. **Advanced** – Graphs, Heaps, Dynamic Programming, Tries, Segment Trees
